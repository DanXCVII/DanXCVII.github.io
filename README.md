# Recipe Bible Web Creator

This github pages website allows for the creation of recipes for the Android App My RecipeBible form the github repo [my_recipe_book](https://github.com/DanXCVII/my_recipe_book). This webpage was created for the faster creation of new recipes since it gives the option to generate new recipes on any device with a browser.  

## Functionality

By filling in the form and adding recipes, one can create multiple recipes for a single import file. The file can be created using the green "save" button at the bottom of the webpage, creating a .json file, which can finally be downloaded and used for importing into the App.
